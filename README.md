# Hi!

My name is Jakub 'bard' Wodyk and I want to be full-time Java Developer. I'm 20 years old and I'm studying philosophy in Warsaw. I'm looking for a job in tech company.

### What is my goal?

As I said previously, I want to become Java Developer. Learning Git is my first step to put myself out for companies. I hope to make my GitHub page a fine portfolio.

### Philosophy and coding? How?

Philosophy is not only talking gibberish and pretending to be smarter than you really are. It is also an art of viewing problem from different perspectives. Rather than asking "How to solve this problem?" I ask myself "What makes it different from other problems I've seen?". This way I can come up with creative ways to solve problems.
